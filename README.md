# Analyze-AB-Test
Analyze ab_data dataset 

## Overview
The main aim of this project is to:
  - Use good coding Practices
  - Correctly Interpret Results
  - Correctly Draw statistical Conclusions

## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
